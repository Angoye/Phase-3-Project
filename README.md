#Phase_3_House-Prices_Feature_engineering

#House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques
#Overview
This project uses the Ames Housing dataset to build a regression model to predict house prices. The analysis focuses on data preprocessing, feature engineering, and creating a regression model to estimate the sale price of properties.

#Objectives
#Goals
Predict the SalePrice of houses using various features, including:
Numerical features: LotArea, GrLivArea, TotalBsmtSF.
Categorical features: Neighborhood, GarageType, HouseStyle.
Ordinal features: OverallQual, ExterQual.
Apply essential data preprocessing techniques for machine learning.
Key Features
Numerical: Continuous and discrete variables representing property details.
Categorical: Descriptive categories for attributes such as neighborhood and style.
Ordinal: Ordered features like quality ratings.
Project Steps
1. Problem Understanding
Define the project objectives and dataset structure.
Highlight key considerations for preprocessing and feature selection.
2. Loading the Data
Load the Ames Housing dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for exploration.
3. Data Preprocessing
Dropping Irrelevant Columns: Retain only necessary features for analysis.
Handling Missing Values: Use MissingIndicator and SimpleImputer to manage missing data.
Encoding Categorical Features: Convert categorical data to numerical using OrdinalEncoder and OneHotEncoder.
4. Model Preparation
Ensure all features are in a numerical format compatible with scikit-learn models.
5. Test Data Preparation
Apply the same preprocessing steps to test data for evaluation.
